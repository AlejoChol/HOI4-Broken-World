look_to_the_oceans:0 "Look to the Oceans"
look_to_the_oceans_desc:0 "We cannot properly ensure our continued survival if we do not look to the oceans near and far, and this means looking at all aspects, from the ships, to the men, to the very cities on our coasts that serve us"

develop_water_resistant_weaponry:0 "Develop Water Resistant Weaponry"
develop_water_resistant_weaponry_desc:0 "Water is nearly everywhere on planet earth, and the fact our primary methods of fighting are so easily misguided when it comes to simple hydration is unacceptable, therefore we must start looking at our marine corps, by improving guns to be more resilient to water based damage, and showing how to maintain them properly"

national_trade_safety_board:0 "National Trade Safety Board"

form_the_marines_desc:0 "To properly lead our force on landing grounds and in harsh, water-logged terrain like marshland and river banks, we must invest in a fighting force trained and equipped to deal with such dangers. This will not be easy, but will benefit us enourmously in the future"

marine_transport_effort:0 "Marine Transport Effort"
marine_transport_effort_desc:0 "Transporting troops from the large transport ships, to the beaches and ports of their landing ground is a vital, vital task, and is currently untennable without further research.

simplify_track_designs:0 "Simplify Tank Track designs"
simplify_track_designs_desc:0 "Our next generation of tanks should have wider tracks and a redesigned hull arrangement that allows them to push through marshlands, soft ground and even shallow to medium depth rivers without much trouble. This will also aid them in naval invasions and will offer some vital experience on naval excersizes"

form_the_merchant_navy:0 "Form the Merchant Navy"
form_the_merchant_navy_desc:0 "Our men who work the convoys are just as much military members as those who work on the guns. All the more so as many of these men join the Merchant corps to escape being shot at. It is time we provide for these men with full military pensions and honours, while reforming the merchant arm into a fully fledged naval subsection"

purchase_foreign_convoy_vessels:0 "Purchase Foreign Convoy Vessels"
purchase_foreign_convoy_vessels_desc:0 "At times we might need to acquire more naval convoys and transports than our dockyards can produce, in these cases leasing and purchasing foreign owned convoy ships from underground sources can provide a necessary fallback if the worst should happen and our dockyards are not available"

expand_marine_recruitment:0 "Expand Marine Recruitment"
expand_marine_recruitment_desc:0 "Our marine corps are presently very small, outdated and primarily made up of older men from previous times not used to todays tactics.

new_transportation_models:0 "New Transportation Models"
new_transportation_models_desc:0 "To properly land troops on beaches, convoys need to be specifically designed to hold and carry transportation landing craft able to traverse shallow waters and survive light arms fire. Redesigning and developing new models will allow us to coordiante more troops on a singular operation, thus improving the chances of making a successful landing"

floating_tank_proposals:0 "Floating Tank Proposals"
floating_tank_proposals_desc:0 "The idea of modifying tanks with propellors, schnorkels and floatational devices capable of keeping a several ton monster suspended might seem outlandish and hilariously rubbish, but if done properly, our men can be given fire support before they even leave the landing craft, and our tanks can find suitable landing spots far more easily. Provided the design didn't just sink like a stone"

doctrines_for_the_sitting_ducks_desc:0 "Just because they are sitting ducks to those that hunt them, doesn't mean we can't develop new strategies for dealing with attacks. For example, teaching captains about wiggle-formations can vastly improve the chances of a convoy escaping a submarine attack, and ensuring the convoy is taught to scatter in the presence of capital ships will limit the damage they do"

elite_training_for_the_companies:0 "Elite Training for the Companies"
